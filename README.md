# 🚀 AI/ML Portfolio Projects  
A collection of applied **AI/ML systems**, including **LLMs**, **RAG**, **agentic AI**, and **NLP pipelines**, designed to demonstrate real-world capabilities in building intelligent applications. This repository currently includes three fully functional projects showcasing chatbot development, recommendation systems, and virtual agent representation.

---

## 📁 Repository Overview  
This repository gathers three core projects:

1. **A WhatsApp-integrated LLM chatbot trained on a custom JSON knowledge base.**  
2. **A bidirectional recommendation system for IT profiles and job vacancies using embeddings and NLP.**  
3. **A virtual representative powered by agentic AI that answers questions about your professional background.**

Each project demonstrates production-oriented AI engineering, including API integration, vector search, document ingestion, model orchestration, and user-facing interfaces.

## 🧠 1. Custom LLM WhatsApp Chatbot  
A personal chatbot trained on your own structured JSON database and connected directly to WhatsApp using OpenAI LLMs.

### **Key Features**
- Uses a **custom knowledge base (JSON + DB)** for grounded, accurate answers.  
- Fully **LLM-powered**, running on OpenAI models (GPT family).  
- Designed to integrate with **WhatsApp** via Business API.  
- Implements a minimal **RAG pipeline** for context retrieval.  
- Ideal for customer support, personal branding, or automated FAQ systems.

### **Tech Stack**
- **Node.js**
- **OpenAI API**
- **WhatsApp Business API**
- JSON-based knowledge ingestion

## 🔍 2. Bidirectional Recommendation System (Profiles ↔ Vacancies)  
A smart recommendation engine matching IT professionals with relevant vacancies, and vice versa.

### **Key Features**
- Frontend built in **ReactJS** for interactive UI.  
- Backend built in **Python**, leveraging:
  - **spaCy**
  - **Embeddings**
  - **NLP pipelines**
- Ranks:
  - **Most relevant profiles for a job**, and  
  - **Most relevant jobs for a profile**  
- Uses semantic vector similarity to interpret skills, experience, tech stack, and metadata.

### **Tech Stack**
- **ReactJS** (frontend)  
- **Python / FastAPI or Flask** (backend)  
- **spaCy NLP**  
- Embeddings-based semantic search

## 🧑‍💼 3. Virtual Representative (Agentic AI)  
An agentic AI system that represents you virtually using your own documents (PDF and TXT) as its knowledge source.

### **Key Features**
- Uses **OpenAI LLMs** with agentic reasoning patterns.  
- Ingests your **PDF résumé** and **TXT notes** to build a personalized knowledge model.  
- Built with **Gradio**, offering a clean and interactive UI.  
- Capable of answering questions about your background, experience, and expertise—acting as your AI-powered avatar.

### **Tech Stack**
- **Python**
- **Gradio**
- **OpenAI API**
- Document ingestion (PDF + TXT)
- Agentic LLM orchestration
